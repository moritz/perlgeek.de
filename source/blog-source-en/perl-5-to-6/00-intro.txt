>DESCRIPTION</a></h3>

<p>Perl 6 is underdocumented. That&#39;s no surprise, because (apart from the specification) writing a compiler for Perl 6 seems to be much more urgent than writing documentation that targets the user.</p>

<p>Unfortunately that means that it&#39;s not easy to learn Perl 6, and that you have to have a profound interest in Perl 6 to actually find the motivation to learn it from the specification, IRC channels or from the test suite.</p>

<p>This project, which I&#39;ll preliminary call &#34;Perl 5 to 6&#34; (in lack of a better name) attempts to fill that gap with a series of short articles.</p>

<p>Each lesson has a rather limited topic, and tries to explain the two or three most important points with very short examples. It also tries to explain why things changed from Perl 5 to 6, and why this is important. I also hope that the knowledge you gain from reading these lessons is enough to basically understand the Synopsis, which are the canonical source of all Perl 6 wisdom.</p>

<p>To keep the reading easy, each lesson should not exceed 200 lines or 1000 words (but it&#39;s a soft limit).</p>

<p>Perhaps the lessons are too short to learn a programming language from them, but I hope that they draw an outline of the language design, which allows you to see its beauty without having to learn the language.</p>

>IT&#39;S NOT</a></h3>

<p>This is not a guide for converting Perl 5 to Perl 6 programs. It is also not a comprehensive list of differences. See <a href="http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/docs/Perl6/Perl5/Differences.pod|Perl6::Perl5::Differences" class="podlinkurl"
>http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/docs/Perl6/Perl5/Differences.pod|Perl6::Perl5::Differences</a> instead if you&#39;re looking for something like that.</p>

<p>It is also not oriented on the current state of the implementations, but on the ideal language as specified.</p>
