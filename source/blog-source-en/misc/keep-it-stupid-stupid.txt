Keep it stupid, stupid!

<p>How hard is it to build a good search engine? Very hard. So far I thought
that only one company has managed to build a search engine that's not only
decent, but good.</p>

<p>Sadly, they seem to have overdone it. Today I searched for <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=tagged+dfa">tagged dfa</a>. I was
looking for a technique used in regex engines. On the front page three out
of ten results actually dealt with the subjects, the other uses of
<em>dfa</em> meant <em>dog friendly area</em>, <em>department of foreign
affairs</em> or other unrelated things.</p>

<p>That's neither bad nor unexpected. But I wanted more specific results, so I
decided against using the abbreviation, and searched for the full form: <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=tagged+deterministic+finite+automaton">tagged
deterministic finite automaton</a>. You'd think that would give better
results, no?</p>

<p>No. It gave worse. On the first result page only one of the hits actually
dealt with the DFAs I was looking for. Actually the first hit contained none
of my search terms. None. It just contained a phrase, which is also sometimes
abbreviated <em>dfa</em>.</p>

<p>WTF? Google seemed to have internally converted my query into an
ambiguous, abbreviated form, and then used that to find matches, without
filtering. So it attempted to be very smart, and came out very stupid.</p>

<p>I doubt that any Google engineer is ever going to read this rant. But if
one is: <strong>Please, Google, keep it stupid, stupid</strong>.</p>

<p>I'm fine with getting automatic suggestions on how to improve my search
query; but please don't automatically "improve" it for me. I want to find what
I search for. I'm not interested in dog friendly areas.</p>
