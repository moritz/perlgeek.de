CPAN Pull Request Challenge: A call to the CPAN authors
<!-- 1420117046 -->
<p>The <a
href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2014/12/take-the-2015-cpan-pull-request-challenge.html">2015
CPAN Pull Request Challenge</a> is ramping up, and so far nearly two hundred
volunteers have signed up, pledging to make one pull request for a CPAN
distribution for each month of the year.</p>

<p>So here's a call to the all the CPAN authors: please be supportive, and if you
don't like for your CPAN distributions to be part of the challenge, please
send an email to <code>neil at bowers dot com</code>, stating your PAUSE ID and the fact
that you want to be excluded.</p>

<p>How to be supportive? The first step is to act on pull requests. If you
don't have time for a review, please say so; getting some response, even if
it's <em>"it'll be some time 'till I get around to reviewing this"</em> is much better
than none.</p>

<p>The volunteers have varied backgrounds; some are seasoned veterans, others
are beginners who will make their first contribution to Open Source. So please
be patient and encouraging.</p>

<p>If you have specific requirements for contributions, add a <a
href="https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-">file called CONTRIBUTING or
CONTRIBUTING.md</a> to your github repositories where you state those
requirements.</p>

<p>And of course, be civil. But that goes without saying, right? :-)</p>

<p>(And to those CPAN authors who haven't done it yet: <a
    href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2014/08/put-your-cpan-distributions-on-github.html">put
your distributions on github</a>, so that you're not left out of the fun!</p>

<p>Happy New Year everybody, and have a great deal of fun!</p>
