CPAN Pull Request Challenge: A call to the CPAN authors
<!-- 1420117046 -->
<p>The <a
href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2014/12/take-the-2015-cpan-pull-request-challenge.html">2015
CPAN Pull Request Challenge</a> is ramping up, and so far nearly two hundred
volunteers have signed up, pledging to make one pull request for a CPAN
distribution for each month of the year.</p>

<p>So here's a call to the all CPAN authors: please be supportive, and if you
don't like for your CPAN distributions to be part of the challenge, please
send an email to neil at bowers dot com, stating your PAUSE ID and the fact
that you want to be excluded.</p>

<p>How to be supportive? The first step is to act on pull requests. If you
don't have time for a review, please say so; getting some response, even if
it's "it'll be some time 'till I get around to reviewing this" is much better
than none.</p>

<p>If you have specific requirements for contributions, add a <a
href="https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-">file called CONTRIBUTING or
CONTRIBUTING.md</a> to your github repositories where you state those
requirements.</p>

<p>And of course, be civil. But that goes without saying, right? :-)</p>

<p>Happy New Year everybody, and have a great deal of fun!</p>
