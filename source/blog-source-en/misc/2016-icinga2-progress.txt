Progress in Icinga2 Land
<!-- 2016-12-21 -->

<p>Last month I <a href="https://perlgeek.de/blog-en/misc/2016-icinga2-api.html">blogged about my negative experiences with the Icinga2 API</a>. Since then, stuff has happened in Icinga2 land,
including a very productive and friendly meeting with the Icinga2 product manager and
two of the core developers.</p>

<p>My first issue was that <a href="https://dev.icinga.com/issues/11731">objects created through the API sometimes don't show up
in the web interface</a>. We learned that this can be avoided by explicitly specifying the <code>zone</code> attribute, and that Icinga 2.6 doesn't require this anymore.</p>

<p>The second issue, <code>CREATE + UPDATE != CREATE</code> isn't easy to fix in Icinga2.
Apply rules can contain basically arbitrary code, and tracking which ones to run,
possibly run in reverse etc. for an update is not easy, and while the Icinga2 developers
want to fix this eventually, the fix isn't yet in sight. The <a href="https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-director">Icinga
Director</a> has a
workaround, but it involves restarting the Icinga daemon for each change or
batch of changes, an operational characteristic we'd like to avoid.
The inability to write templates through the API stems from the same
underlying problem, so we won't see write support for templates soon.</p>

<p>The API quirks will likely remain. With support from the Icinga2 developers, I was
able to get selection by element of an array variable working, though the
process did involve finding at least one more bug in Icinga. The developers
are working on that one, though :-).</p>

<p>Even though my bug report requesting more documentation has been closed, the
Netways folks <em>have</em> improved the documentation thoroughly, and there are
plans for even more improvements, for example making it easier to find the
relevant docs by more cross-linking.</p>

<p>All in all, there is a definitive upwards trend in Icinga2's quality, and in
my perception of it. I'd like to thank the Icinga2 folks at Netways for their
work, and for taking the time to talk to a very vocal critic.</p>
