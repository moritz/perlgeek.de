Goodby Iron Man

<p>So I accepted the <a href="http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/">Iron
Man</a> blogging challenge a few month ago. And last week I discovered that my
blog was gone from their feed. For the second time. Without any
notification.</p>

<div style="border: 1px">

</div>

<p>The first time they had a good reason: the date tags in my RSS feed were
goofed; still I'd thought it would be nice to at least notify me of such a
removal. After some mails back and forth I was able to fix it; after the
second removal without any notification I'm simply fed up and don't want to
investigate any more energy into this.</p>

<p>Still I'll continue to follow the collected RSS feed, there are still many
interesting blogs to be read there.</p>
