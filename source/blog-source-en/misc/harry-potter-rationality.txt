Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality
<!-- 1290461312 -->
<p>What if Harry Potter had been raised by a loving stepmother? What if his
stepfather was a scientist? What happens when somebody tries to analyze magic
with scientific methods? What happens if an eleven year old boy is too smart
for his own good?</p>

<p>A piece of fan fiction, <a
href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality">Harry
Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a> by <a
href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences">"Less Wrong"</a> answers those
questions - and makes quite a good read. If you are into fantasy books and
science, you might really love it. I did.</p>

<p>But be warned: only read this if you've read all seven Harry Potter books
by J.K.Rowling, because the fan fiction piece contains lots of spoilers.</p>

<p>So far 60 chapters for varying length have been published, and just a few
more to be written before the first year ends. I look forward to the final
chapters.</p>
