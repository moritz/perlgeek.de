Doubt and Confidence
<!-- 1259967600 -->

<p>
    &lt;meta&gt;From my <em>useless musings</em> series.&lt;/meta&gt;
</p>

<p>
    As a programmer you have to have confidence in your skills, to some
    extent, and at the same time you have to constantly doubt them. Weird, eh?
</p>

<h2>Confidence</h2>

<p>
    You need some level of confidence to do anything efficiently.
    Planning ahead requires confidence that you can achieve the steps
    on your way.
</p>

<p>
    As a programmer you also need some confidence with the language,
    libraries and other tools you're using.
</p>

<p>
    If you program for money, you also have to assess what kind of programs
    you can write, and where you might have problems.
</p>

<h2>Doubt</h2>

<p>
    In the process of programming you make a lot of assumptions, some of the
    explicit, some of them implicit. If you want to write a good program, it's
    essential that you are aware of as many assumptions as possible.
</p>

<p>
    When you find a bug in your program, you have to challenge previous
    assumptions, and that's where doubt comes in. You not only suspect, but
    you <em>know</em> that at least one of the assumptions was false (or maybe
    just a bit too specific), and you know that <em>you</em> did something
    wrong.
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes programmers make really stupid mistakes which are rather tricky
    to track down. That's when you have to question your own sanity.
</p>

<p>
    One example (that luckily doesn't happen all that often to me) is when I
    edit my program, and nothing seems to change. Nothing at all. Depending on
    the setup it might be some cache, but something it is even more
    devious - for example I didn't notice that the console where I edit and
    the console where I test are on different hosts - and thus the edits
    actually have no effect at all.
</p>

<p>
    After having done such a thing once or twice I adopted the habit of just
    adding a <code>die('BOOM');</code> instruction to my code, to verify that
    the part I'm looking at is actually run.
</p>

<p>
    These are moments when I question my own sanity, thinking "how could I
    have possibly done such a stupid thing?". Doubt.
</p>

<p>
    The same phenomena applies when doing scientific research: since you
    usually do things that nobody has done before (or at nobody has published
    about it yet), you can't know the results beforehand -- if you could, your
    research would be rather boring. So you have no external reference for
    verification, only your intuition and discussion with peers.
