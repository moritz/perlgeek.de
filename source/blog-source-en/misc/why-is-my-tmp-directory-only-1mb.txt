Why is my /tmp/ directory suddenly only 1MB big?
<!-- 1308070080 -->

<p>Today I got a really weird error on my Debian "Squeeze" Linux box --
a processes tried to write a temp file, and it complained that there was
<code>No space left on device</code>.</p>

<p>The weird thing is, just yesterday my root parition was full, and I had
made about 7GB free space in it.</p>

<p>I checked, there was still plenty of room today. But behold:</p>

<pre>
$ df -h /tmp/
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
overflow              1.0M  632K  392K  62% /tmp
</pre>

<p>So, suddenly my /tmp/ directory was a ram disc with just 1MB of space. And
it didn't show up in <code>/etc/fstab</code>, so I had no idea what cause
it.</p>

<p>After googling a bit around, I found the likely reason: <a
href="http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-sysvinit-devel/2007-June/001973.html">as
a protection against low disc space, some daemon automatically "shadows" the
current /tmp/ dir with a ram disc if the the root partition runs out of disc
space</a>. Sadly there's no automatic reversion of that process once enough
disc space is free again.</p>

<p>To remove the mount, you can say (as root)</p>

<pre>
umount -l /tmp/
</pre>

<p>And to permanently disable this feature, use</p>

<pre>
echo 'MINTMPKB=0' &gt; /etc/default/mountoverflowtmp
</pre>
