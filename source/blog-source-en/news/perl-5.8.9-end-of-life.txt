Perl-5.8.9 is "end of life" release
<!-- 1225926000 -->
<p>Today Nicholas Clark, pumpking of the 5.8-maint branch of perl, <a
href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2008/11/msg141328.html">announced
that 5.8.9 will be the last release of that branch.</a></p>

<p>After this release, it will only receive the same amount of care as all
other perl versions do, which boils down to patches for gaping security
holes.</p>

<p>I welcome the announcement, because ongoing migration to Perl 5.10 means
that I can use <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=654086">these cool
features</a> in my code. Since Debian Lenny
(scheduled for September this year, but delayed a bit) comes with perl-5.10.0,
I'll upgrade soon.</p>
