Parrot and llvm-gcc

<p>Yesterday I <a
href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.internals/2008/07/msg47425.html">built
parrot</a> with llvm-gcc 4.2 and  <a href="http://llvm.org/">llvm 2.2</a>. It
was nice to see all tests passing, which IMHO is a good sign for both parrot
and llvm.</p>

<p>It gave no speed benefit over the ordinary gcc 4.2, but I'll try again with
later versions of llvm and see how it evolves.</p>

<p>I also tried to compile parrot with <a
href="http://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a>, but couldn't figure out how not to
pass linker options to <code>llvm-ld</code> that it doesn't understand, and I
gave up rather quickly.</p>
