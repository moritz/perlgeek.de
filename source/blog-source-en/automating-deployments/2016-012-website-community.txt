Automating Deployments: New Website, Community
<!-- 2016-03-05 -->

<p>No IT project would be complete without its own website, so my project of
writing a book on automated deployments now has one too. Please visit <a
href="https://deploybook.com/">deploybook.com</a> and tell me what you think
about. The plan is to gradually add some content, and maybe also a bit of
color. When the book finally comes out (don't hold your breath here, it'll
take some more months), it'll also be for sale there.</p>

<p>Quite a few readers have emailed me, sharing their own thoughts on the
topic of building and deploying software, and often asking for feedback. There
seems to be a need for a place to share these things, so I created one. <a
href="http://community.deploybook.com/">The deployment community</a> is a
discourse forum dedicated to discussing such things. I expect to see a low
volume of posts, but valuables to those involved.</p>

<p>To conclude the news roundup for this week, I'd like to mention that next
week I'll be giving a talk on continuous delivery at the <a
href="http://act.yapc.eu/gpw2016/">German Perl Workshop 2016</a>, where I'm
also one of the organizers. After the workshop is over, slides will be
available online, and I'll likely have more time again for blogging. So stay
tuned!</p>
