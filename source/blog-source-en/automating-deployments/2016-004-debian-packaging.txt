Automating Deployments: Building Debian Packages
<!-- 2016-01-06 -->

<p>I have <a
href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/automating-deployments/2016-003-simplistic-deployment-git-pull.html">argued
before that it is a good idea to build packages from software you want to
automatically deploy</a>. The package manager gives you dependency management
as well as the option to execute code at defined points in the installation
process, which is very handy for restarting services after installation,
creating necessary OS-level users and so on.</p>

<h3>Which package format to use?</h3>

<p>There are many possible package formats and managers for them out there.
Many ecosystems and programming languages come with their own, for example
Perl uses CPAN.pm or cpanminus to install Perl modules, the NodeJS community
uses npm, ruby has the gem installer, python pip and easyinstall, and so
on.</p>

<p>One of the disadvantages is that they only work well for one language. If
you or your company uses applications uses software in multiple programming
languages, and you chose to use the language-specific packaging formats and
tools for each, you burden yourself and the operators with having to know (and
being aware of) these technologies.</p>

<p>Operating teams are usually familiar with the operating system's package
manager, so using that seems like an obvious choice. Especially if the same
operating system family is used throughout the whole organization. In specialized
environments, other solutions might be preferable.</p>

<h3>What's in a Debian package, and how do I build one?</h3>

<p>A <code>.deb</code> file is an <code>ar</code> archive with meta data about
the archive format version, meta data for the package (name, version,
installation scripts) and the files that are to be installed.</p>

<p>While it is possible to build such a package directly, the easier and much
more common route is to use the tooling provided by the <a
href="http://man.he.net/man1/devscripts">devscripts</a> package. These tools
expect the existence of a <code>debian/<code> directory with various files in
them.</p>

<p><code>debian/control</code> contains information such as the package
name, dependencies, maintainer and description. <code>debian/rules</code> is a
makefile that controls the build process of the debian package.
<code>debian/changelog</code> contains a human-readable summary of changes to
the package. The top-most changelog entry determines the resulting version of
the package.</p>

<p>You can use <code>dh_make</code> from the <code>dh-make</code> package to
generate a skeleton of files for the <code>debian/</code> directory, which you
can then edit to your liking. This will ask your for the architecture of the
package. You can use a specific one like <code>amd64</code>, or the word
<code>any</code> for packages that can be build on any architecture. If
resulting package is architecture independent (as as is the case for many
scripting languages), using <code>all</code> as the architecture is
appropriate.</p>

<h3>Build process of a Debian package</h3>

<p>If you use <code>dh_make</code> to create a skeleton,
<code>debian/rules</code> mostly consists of a catch-all rule that calls
<code>dh $@</code>. This is tool that tries to do the right thing for each
build step automatically, and usually it succeeds. If there is a
<code>Makefile</code> in your top-level directory, it will call the
<code>configure</code>, <code>build</code>, <code>check</code> and
<code>install</code> make targets for you. If your build system installs into
the <code>DESTDIR</code> prefix (which is set to
<code>debian/your-package-name</code>), it should pretty much work out of the
box.</p>

<p>If you want to copy additional files into the Debian package, listing the
file names, one on each line, in <code>debian/install</code>, that is done
automatically for you.</p>

<h3>Shortcuts</h3>

<p>If you have already packaged your code for distribution through
language-specific tools, such as CPAN (Perl) or pip (Python), there are
shortcuts to creating Debian Packages.</p>

<h4>Perl</h4>

<p>The tool <code>dh-make-perl</code> (installable via the package of the same
name) can automatically create a <code>debian</code> directory based on the
perl-specific packaging. Calling <code>dh-make-perl .</code> inside the root
directory of your perl source tree is often enough to create a functional
Debian package. It sticks to the naming convention that a Perl package
Awesome::Module becomes libawesome-module-perl in Debian land.</p>

<h4>Python</h4>

<p><code>py2dsc</code> from the <code>python-stdeb</code>package generates a
<code>debian/</code> directory from an existing python tarball.</p>

<p>Another approach is to use <a
    href="http://dh-virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/0.10/usage.html">dh-virtualenv</a>.
This copies all of the python dependencies into a virtualenv, so the resulting
packages only depends on the system python and possible C libraries that the
python packages use; all python-level dependencies are baked in. This tends to
produce bigger packages with fewer dependencies, and allows you to run several
python programs on a single server, even if they depend on different versions
of the same python library.</p>

<p>dh-virtualenv has an unfortunate choice of default installation prefix that
clashes with some assumptions that Debian's python packages make. You can
override that choice in <code>debian/rules</code>:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/make -f
export DH_VIRTUALENV_INSTALL_ROOT=/usr/share/nnis
%:
        dh $@ --with python-virtualenv --with systemd
</pre>

<p>It also assumes Pyhton 2 by default. For a Python 3 based project, add
these lines:</p>

<pre>
override_dh_virtualenv:
        dh_virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3
</pre>

<p>(As always with Makefiles, be sure to indent with hard tabulator
characters, not with spaces).</p>
