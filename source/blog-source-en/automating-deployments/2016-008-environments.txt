Automating Deployments: 3+ Environments
<!-- 2016-01-19 -->

<p>Software is written to run in a <em>production</em> environment.
This is where the goal of the business is achieved: making money for the
business, or reaching and educating people, or whatever the reason for writing
the software is. For websites, this is the typically the Internet-facing
public servers.</p>

<p>But the production environment is not where you want to develop software.
Developing is an iterative process, and comes with its own share of mistakes
and corrections. You don't want your customers to see all those mistakes as
you make them, so you develop in a different environment, maybe on your PC or
laptop instead of a server, with a different database (though hopefully using
the same database software as in the production environment), possibly
using a different authentication mechanism, and far less data than the
production environment has.</p>

<p>You'll likely want to prevent certain interactions in the development
environment that are desirable in production: Sending notifications (email,
SMS, voice, you name it), charging credit cards, provisioning virtual
machines, opening rack doors in your data center and so on. How that is done
very much depends on the interaction. You can configure a mail transfer agent
to deliver all mails to a local file or mail box. Some APIs have dedicated
testing modes or installations; in the worst case, you might have to write a
mock implementation that answers similarly to the original API, but doesn't
carry out the action that the original API does.</p>

<p>Deploying software straight to production if it has only been tested on the
developer's machine is a rather bad practice. Often the environments are too
different, and the developer unknowingly relied on a feature of his
environment that isn't the same in the production environment. Thus it is quite
common to have one or more environments in between where the software is
deployed and tested, and only propagated to the next deployment environment
when all the tests in the previous one were successful.</p>

<p>One of these stages is often called <em>testing</em>. This is where the
software is shown to the stakeholders to gather feedback, and if manual QA
steps are required, they are often carried out in this environment (unless
there is a separate environment for that).</p>

<p>A reason to have another non-production environment is test service
dependencies. If several different software components are deployed to the
testing environment, and you decide to deploy one or two at a time to
production, things might break in production. The component you deployed might
have a dependency on a newer version of another component, and since the
testing environment contained that newer version, nobody noticed. Or maybe a
database upgrade in the testing environment failed, and had to be repaired
manually; you don't want the same to happen in a production setting, so you
decide to test in another environment first.</p>

<img src="//perlgeek.de/images/blog/ad/environments-staging.png"
alt="After a software is modified in the development environment, it is
deployed to the testing environment (with its own database), and if all tests
were successful, propagated to the staging  environment. Only if this works is
the deployment to production carried out" width="513" height="207" />

<p>Thus many companies have another <em>staging</em> environment that mirrors
the production environment as closely as possible. A planned production
deployment is first carried out in the staging environment, and on success
done in production too, or rolled back on error.</p>

<p>There are valid reasons to have more environments even. If automated
performance testing is performed, it should be done in an separate environment
where no manual usage is possible to avoid distorting results. Other tests
such as automated acceptance or penetration testings are best done in their
own environment.</p>

     alt="One can add more environments for automated acceptance, penetration
     and performance testing for example; those typically come before the
     staging environment." width="710" height="160" />

<p>In addition, dedicated environment for testing and evaluating explorative
features are possible.</p>

<p>It should be noted that while these environment all serve valid purposes,
they also come at a cost. Machines, either virtual or native, on which all
those environments run must be available, and they consume resources. They
must be set up initially and maintained. License costs must be considered (for
example for proprietary databases). Also the time for deploying code increases
as the number of environment increases. With more environments, automating
deployments and maybe even management and configuration of the infrastructure
becomes mandatory.</p>
