Automating Deployments: Debian Packaging for an Example Project
<!-- 2016-01-09 -->

<p>After <a href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/automating-deployments/2016-004-debian-packaging.html">general
notes on Debian packaging</a>, I want to introduce an example project, and how
it's packaged.</p>

<h3>The Project</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/moritz/package-info">package-info</a> is a
minimalistic web project, written solely for demonstrating packaging and
deployment. When called in the browser, it produces a text document containing
the output of <code>dpkg -l</code>, which gives an overview of installed (and
potentially previously installed) packages, their version, installation state
and a one-line description.</p>

<p>It is written in Perl using the <a
href="http://mojolicious.org/">Mojolicious</a> web framework.</p>

<p>The actual code resides in the file
<code>usr/lib/package-info/package-info</code> and is delightfully short:</p>

<pre>[% syntax perl %]
#!/usr/bin/perl
use Mojolicious::Lite;

plugin 'Config';

get '/' => sub {
    my $c = shift;

    $c->render(text => scalar qx/dpkg -l/, format => 'text');
};

app->start;
[% endsyntax %]</pre>

<p>It loads the "Lite" version of the framework, registers a route for the URL
<code>/</code>, which renders as plain text the output of the system command
<code>dpkg -l</code>, and finally starts the application.</p>

<p>It also loads the <a
href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious::Plugin::Config">Config-Plugin</a>,
which is used to specify the PID file for the server process.</p>

<p>The corresponding config file in <code>etc/package-info.conf</code> looks
like this:</p>

<pre>[% syntax perl %]
#!/usr/bin/perl
{
    hypnotoad => {
        pid_file => '/var/run/package-info/package-info.pid',
    },
}
[% endsyntax %]</pre>

<p>which again is perl code, and  specifies the location of the PID file when
run under hypnotoad, the application server recommended for use with
Mojolicious.</p>

<p>To test it, you can install the <code>libmojolicious-perl</code> package,
and run <code>MOJO_CONFIG=$PWD/etc/package-info.conf morbo
usr/lib/package-info/package-info</code>. This starts a development server on
port 3000. Pointing your browser at http://127.0.0.1:3000/, you should see a
list like this:</p>

<p>though much longer.</p>

<h3>Initial Packaging</h3>

<p>Installing <code>dh-make</code> and running <code>dh_make --createorig -p
package-info_0.1</code> gives us a <code>debian</code> directory along
with several files.</p>

<p>I started by editing <code>debian/control</code> to look like this:</p>

<pre>
Source: package-info
Section: main
Priority: optional
Maintainer: Moritz Lenz <moritz.lenz@gmail.com>
Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 9)
Standards-Version: 3.9.5

Package: package-info
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, libmojolicious-perl
Description: Web service for getting a list of installed packages
</pre>

<p>Debian packages support the notion of <em>source package</em>, which a
maintainer uploads to the Debian build servers, and from which one or more
<em>binary package</em> are built. The <code>control</code> reflects this
structure, with the first half being about the source package and its build
dependencies, and the second half being about the binary package.</p>

<p>Next I deleted the file <code>debian/source/format</code>, which by default
indicates the use of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilt_%28software%29">quilt patch
management</a> system, which isn't typically used in git based workflows.</p>

<p>I leave <code>debian/rules</code>, <code>debian/compat</code> and
<code>debian/changelog</code> untouched, and create a file
<code>debian/install</code> with two lines:</p>

<pre>
etc/package-info.conf
usr/lib/package-info/package-info
</pre>

<p>In lieu of a proper build system, this tells <code>dh_install</code> which
files to copy into the debian package.</p>

<p>This is a enough for a building a Debian package. To trigger the build,
this command suffices:</p>

<pre>debuild -b -us -uc</pre>

<p>The <code>-b</code> instructs debuild to only create a binary package, and
the two <code>-u*</code> options skips the steps where debuild
cryptographically signs the generated files.</p>

<p>This command creates three files in the directory above the source tree:
<code>package-info_0.1-1_all.deb</code>,
<code>package-info_0.1-1_amd64.changes</code> and
<code>package-info_0.1-1_amd64.build</code>. The .deb file contains the actual
program code and meta data, the .changes file meta data about the package as
well as the last changelog entry, and the .build file a transcript of the
build process.</p>

<h3>A Little Daemonology</h3>

<p>Installing the .deb file from the previous step would install a working
software, but you'd have to start it manually.</p>

<p>Instead, it is useful to provide means to automatically start the server
process at system boot time. Traditionally, this has been done by shipping
init scripts. Since Debian transitioned to systemd as its init system with the
"Jessie"  / 8 version, systemd service files are the new way to go, and
luckily much shorter than a robust init script.</p>

<p>The service file goes into <code>debian/package-info.service</code>:</p>

<pre>
[Unit]
Description=Package installation information via http
Requires=network.target
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
RemainAfterExit=yes
SyslogIdentifier=package-info
PIDFile=/var/run/package-info/package-info.pid
Environment=MOJO_CONFIG=/etc/package-info.conf
ExecStart=/usr/bin/hypnotoad /usr/lib/package-info/package-info -f
ExecStop=/usr/bin/hypnotoad -s /usr/lib/package-info/package-info
ExecReload=/usr/bin/hypnotoad /usr/lib/package-info/package-info
</pre>

<p>The <code>[Unit]</code> section contains the service description, as well
as the specification when it starts. The <code>[Service]</code> section
describes the service type, where <code>simple</code> means that systemd
expects the start command to not terminate as long as the process is running.
With <code>Environment</code>, environment variables can be set for all three
of the ExecStart, ExecStop and ExecReload commands.</p>

<p>Another debhelper, <code>dh-systemd</code> takes care of installing the
service file, as well as making sure the service file is read  and the service
started or restarted after a package installation. To enable it,
<code>dh-systemd</code> must be added to the <code>Build-Depends</code> line
in file <code>debian/control</code>, and the catch-all build rule in
<code>debian/rules</code> be changed to:</p>

<pre>
%:
        dh $@ --with systemd
</pre>

<p>To enable hypnotoad to write the PID file, the containing directory must
exists. Writing <code>/var/run/package-info/</code> into a new
<code>debian/dirs</code> file ensures this directory is created at package
installation.</p>

<p>To test the changes, again invoke <code>debuild -b -us -uc</code> and
install the resulting .deb file with <code>sudo dpkg -i
    ../package-info_0.1-1_all.deb</code>.</p>

<p>The server process should now listen on port 8080, so you can test it with
<code>curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/ | head</code>.</p>

<h3>A Bit More Security</h3>

<p>As it is now, the application server and the application run as the root
user, which violates the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">Principle of
least privilege</a>. Instead it should run as a separate user,
<code>package-info</code> that isn't allowed to do much else.</p>

<p>To make the installation as smooth as possible, the package should create
the user itself if it doesn't exist. The <code>debian/postinst</code> script
is run at package installation time, and is well suited for such tasks:</p>

<pre>[% syntax sh %]
#!/bin/sh

set -e
test $DEBIAN_SCRIPT_DEBUG && set -v -x

export PATH=$PATH:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin

USER="package-info"

case "$1" in
    configure)
        if ! getent passwd $USER >/dev/null ; then
            adduser --system $USER
        fi
        chown -R $USER /var/run/package-info/
    ;;
esac

#DEBHELPER#

exit 0
[% endsyntax %]</pre>

<p>There are several actions that a postinst script can execute, and
<code>configure</code> is the right one for creating users. At this time, the
files are already installed.</p>

<p>Note that it also changes the permissions for the directory in which the
PID file is created, so that when <code>hypnotoad</code> is invoked as the
<code>package-info</code> user, it can still create the PID file.</p>

<p>Please note the presence of the <code>#DEBHELPER#</code> tag, which the
build system replaces with extra actions. Some of these come from
<code>dh-systemd</code>, and take care of restarting the service after
installation, and enabling it for starting after a reboot on first
installation.</p>

<p>To set the user under which the service runs, adding the line
<code>User=package-info</code> to the <code>[UNIT]</code> section of
<code>debian/package-info.service</code>.</p>

<p>Linux offers more security features that can be enabled in a declarative
way in the systemd service file in the <code>[Unit]</code> section. Here are a few
that protect the rest of the system from the server process, should it be
exploited:</p>

<pre>
PrivateTmp=yes
InaccessibleDirectories=/home
ReadOnlyDirectories=/bin /sbin /usr /lib /etc
</pre>

<p>Additional precautions can be taken by limiting the number of processes
that can be spawned and the available memory through the
<code>LimitNPROC</code> and <code>MemoryLimit</code> options.</p>

<h3>The importance of good packaging</h3>

<p>If you tune your packages so that they do as much configuration and
environment setup themselves, you benefit two-fold. It makes it easy to the
package in any context, regardless of whether it is embedded in a deployment
system. But even if it is part of a deployment system, putting the package
specific bits into the package itself helps you keep the deployment system
generic, and thus easy to extend to other packages.</p>

<p>For example configuration management systems such as Ansible, Chef and Puppet
allow you to create users and to restart services when a new package version
is available, but if you rely on that, you have to treat each package
separately in the configuration management system.</p>
