Moritz on Continuous Discussions (#c9d9)
<!-- 2016-08-11 -->

<p>On Tuesday I was a panelist on the <a href="http://electric-cloud.com/blog/2016/08/continuous-discussions-c9d9-podcast-episode-47-open-source-and-devops/">Continuous Discussions Episode
47 â€“ Open Source and
DevOps</a>.
It was quite some fun!</p>

<p>Much of the discussion applied to Open Source in general software development,
not just DevOps.</p>

<p>You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=344WBN1sPI8">the full session</a>
on Youtube, or on the <a href="http://electric-cloud.com/blog/2016/08/continuous-discussions-c9d9-podcast-episode-47-open-source-and-devops/">Electric Cloud
blog</a>.</p>
