Does Your Bug Tracker Do This For You?
<!-- 1294568537 -->

<p>While working on a <a href="http://rakudo.org/">fast moving Open Source
project</a>, we sometimes get some platform specific bug reports. And even if
nobody explicitly works on the problem, sometimes they go away due to general
improvements of robustness.</p>

<p>So sometimes an intrepid volunteer goes through the list of old bugs, and
asks the reporter if these platform specific bugs still persist. Quite often,
we don't get a reply. Then the reports aren't very useful to us, and should be
closed. Which requires a second pass through the bug queue. With more than
600 open bugs this quite a bit of work.</p>

<p>So I'd like to have an option to automatically close a bug within a given
time span (say, four weeks or two months) if no feedback occurs.
<a href="http://bestpractical.com/rt/">Our bug tracker</a> (or at least our
installation) doesn't have such a button.</p>

<p>Does your favorite bug tracker have it? Would you also sometimes like such
a button?</a>
