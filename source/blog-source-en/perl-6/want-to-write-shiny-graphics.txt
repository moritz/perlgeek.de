Want to write shiny SVG graphics with Perl 6? Port Scruffy!
<!-- 1278942207 -->

<p>First let my apologize for waiting so long to come up with a new 
<a href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/contribute-now-announce.html">"weekly"
    Perl 6 challenge</a> - I'm running out of ideas, and then one I have left needs
more time to prepare.</p>

<p>Instead I want to motivated you to help porting the ruby <a
href="http://scruffy.rubyforge.org/">scruffy charting library</a> to Perl 6.
It can generate <a
    href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080625015853/http://scruffy.rubyforge.org/">shiny
SVG graphics</a> (they are currently broken on their main website, hence the
waybackmachine link).</p>


<p>There's already an <a href="http://github.com/moritz/tufte/">initial
version Perl 6 port called "tufte"</a>, but it's not running yet. It needs your
help. If you know some little ruby, and want to learns some more Perl 6, join
#perl6, ask for a commit bit, and translate some ruby code into Perl 6. And in
the end you'll be rewarded with nice SVG charts :-).</p>
