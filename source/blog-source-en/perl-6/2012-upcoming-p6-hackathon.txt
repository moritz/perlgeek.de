Upcoming Perl 6 Hackathon in Oslo, Norway
<!-- 1332263752 -->

<p>The Oslo Perl Mongers are <a
href="https://gist.github.com/1711730">inviting to the Perl 6 Patterns
Hackathon in Oslo</a> in one month, and I very much look forward to being
there.</p>

<p>Hackathons can be quite fun and productive if many programmers focus on the
same goal. So to make the hackathon a success, I'm willing to work on whatever
we decide to set as our goal(s).</p>

<p>One topic that is dear to me, and that is approachable by a horde of
programmers (and guided by one or two Rakudo core hackers) is bringing
database access into a usable state.</p>

<p>With <a
href="http://6guts.wordpress.com/2012/01/29/this-months-rakudo-star-release-and-whats-coming-next/">muchly
    improved support for calling C functions</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/jnthn/zavolaj/">NativeCall.pm</a> we should have
enough infrastructure for access mysql, postgres and SQLite databases. <a
href="https://github.com/mberends/MiniDBI">MiniDBI</a> aims to provide some
basic convenience, but currently only the mysql driver partially works.</p>

<p>I believe that with concentrated effort, MiniDBI and the rest of the
infrastructure can be improved to the point that it is usable, and other
modules can start to rely on it. Databases usable in Perl 6, doesn't that
sound good?</p>

<p>I'll see what kind of feedback I get on this idea, and if it's positive,
I'll follow up with instructions on how to install the prerequisites for
hacking on MiniDBI and its drivers.</p>
