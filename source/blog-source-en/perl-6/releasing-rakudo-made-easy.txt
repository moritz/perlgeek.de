Releasing Rakudo made easy
<!-- 1248375902 -->

<p>Two weeks ago <a href="http://pmichaud.com/">Patrick Michaud</a> asked for
<a href="http://rakudo.org/node/49">volunteers to release</a> <a
href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo Perl 6</a>.</p>

<p>So I first did a fake release some days ago, and it went pretty well. All I
had to do was follow <a
href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/9b37b818f4df7002411c877235c192dcfc2a0c7b/docs/release_guide.pod">the
instructions</a> - no magic required.</p>

<p>Then it turned out that Patrick was busy at the OSCON, and asked me to do
the July release for real. <a href="http://rakudo.org/node/50">Which I
did</a>. Which was also no magic.</p>

<p>Please note that I am familiar with Rakudo, I know in which steps it is
built, where which functionality is - but I'm very far from understanding how
most things work; luckily I didn't have to.</p>

<p>All in all I think I spent about an hour for the release, not counting the
time in which I built it and ran tests - but those things didn't require any
attention, I did other things in the mean time.</p>

<p>So to summarize: it's simple; you don't have to be an Ã¼ber hacker to do it.
You just need some basic familiarity with Rakudo, and a bit of free time.</p>

<p>If you want to support us and gather some fame, consider doing a release for
us.</p>
