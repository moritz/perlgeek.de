A new Perl 6 community server - update
<!-- 1417538144 -->
<p>In my <a href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/2014-community-server-funding.html">previous post</a> I announced my plans for a new
Perl 6 community server (successor to feather.perl6.nl), and now I'd like to
share some updates.</p>

<p>Thanks to the generosity of the Perl 6 community, the server has been
ordered and paid. I am now in the process of contacting those donors who
haven't paid yet, leaving them the choice to re-purpose their pledge to
ongoing costs (traffic, public IPv4 addresses, domain(s), SSL certs if
necessary) and maintenance, or withdraw their pledges.</p>

<p>Some details of the hardware we'll get:</p>

<ul>
    <li>CPU: Intel® Xeon® Haswell-EP Series Processor
E5-2620 v3, 2.40 GHz, 6-Core Socket 2011-3, 15MB
Cache, with hyperthreading (so 12 virtual CPUs)</li>
    <li>RAM: 4x8GB DDR4 DDR4 PC2133 Reg. ECC 2R</li>
    <li>HD: 2x 2TB SATA3-HD</li>
</ul>

<p>The vendor has told me that all parts have arrived, and will be assembled
today or tomorrow.</p>

<p>Currently I lean towards using KVM to create three virtual hosts: one for
websites (*.perl6.org, perlcabal.syn), one for general hacking and IRC
activity, and one for high-risk stuff (evalbots, try.rakudo.org, ...).</p>

<p>I've secured the domain p6c.org (for "perl 6 community"), and the
IPv4 range 213.95.82.52 - 213.95.82.62 and the IPv6 net
2001:780:101:ff00::/64.</p>

<p>So the infrastructure is in place, now I'm waiting for the delivery of the
hardware.</p>
