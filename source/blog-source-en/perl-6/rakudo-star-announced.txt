Rakudo "star" announced
<!-- 1249453512 -->

<p>(<strong>Update:</strong>: <a
   href="http://use.perl.org/~pmichaud/journal/39411">Here is the "official"
   blog post from pmichaud</a> - which pretty much makes my rambling
   superfluous.)
</p>

<p>
    Yesterday <a href="http://pmichaud.com/">Patrick Michaud</a> announced
    that he'll <a
    href="http://brunorc.wordpress.com/2009/08/04/perl-6-release-or-xmas-in-easter/">release
    a special version of Rakudo called <em>Rakudo star</em></a> in
    Spring 2010. Sadly I was not present, but as minor minion I picked some
    things up on IRC and want to provide some backgrounds.
</p>

<p>
    Alias <a href="http://use.perl.org/~Alias/journal/39406">bitched about the
    term "Spring"</a>, which is a rather regional thing and of course he is
    right. I'd like to clarify that we are talking about spring on the
    northern hemisphere, so the release will probably be between March and June.
</p>

<p>
    The idea behind this release is to provide something more shiny than our
    usual development releases, get good press for it, and motivate lots of
    people to use it. We need that for several reasons:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        A release is the only way to get good testing from a wide audience; we
        learned as much from the perl-5.10.0 release, for which many new bugs 
        were only found after the release.
    </li>
    <li>
        Many Perl 5 programmers are vaguely excited about Perl 6, but
        wait for a "real thing" before they spend more time on it. We want
        to show these people that Rakudo has become a "real thing" by now,
        and implements much of the language.
    </li>
    <li>
        We want to encourage hackers to port their Perl 5 modules to Perl 6.
        For them it's a good way to learn Perl 6, for the rest of the
        community it provides a valuable ecosystem. Perl is a good example
        of how a great collection of libraries can greatly enhance a
        languages popularity - we'd like to have such a bonus for Perl 6 too.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Currently the Rakudo developers mostly focus on features that are either
    at the very heart of Perl 6, or that are needed for bootstrapping.
    Examples for the first category re the object model, multi dispatch and 
    regexes/grammars. The second category covers features like contextual
    variables, proto regexes and longest token matching.
</p>

<p>
    I expect the focus to (temporarily) shift towards other features, like
    improved module loading/importing and maybe speedups. But still there are
    areas that not yet actively pursued - the <a
    href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/24b26a0e5319646877f9cdfa5976062e1a02b95a/docs/ROADMAP">roadmap</a>
    does not even mention concurrency/threads. So we hope for volunteers to
    step up and champion their pet projects.
</p>

<p>
    In the last few months various pieces of PR helped to bring more people
    into the Perl 6 community. I hope that the Rakudo star release will boost
    that and will help to form a healthy Perl 6 community.
