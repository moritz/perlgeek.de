Announcing try.rakudo.org, an interactive Perl 6 shell in your browser
<!-- 1285070622 -->

<p>It is my pleasure to announce <a
href="http://try.rakudo.org/">try.rakudo.org</a>, an interactive Perl 6 shell
in your browser, based on the <a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo Perl 6
compiler</a>.</p>

<p>It gives you the opportunity to try out small pieces of Perl 6 code without
having to install a compiler yourself, and show the results to your
colleagues.</p>

<p>Future plans for try.rakudo.org include a tutorial, which gives you
instructions that you can try out immediately.</p>


<p>Credits for creating the site go to John "ash" Harrison and cygx; hosting
is provided by <a href="http://juerd.nl/site.plp/">Juerd Waalboer</a> on <a
href="http://feather.perl6.nl/">feather</a>.</p>
