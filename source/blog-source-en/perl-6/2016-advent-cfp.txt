Perl 6 Advent Calendar 2016 -- Call for Authors
<!-- 2016-11-01 -->
<p>Every year since 2009, the Perl 6 community publishes a Perl 6 advent
calendar, in the form of blog posts on <a
href="https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/">perl6advent.wordpress.com</a>.</p>

<p>To keep up this great tradition, we need 24 blog posts, and volunteers who
write them. If you want to contribute a blog post about anything related to
Perl 6, please add your name (and potentially also a topic already) to the <a
href="https://github.com/perl6/mu/blob/master/misc/perl6advent-2016/schedule">schedule</a>,
and if you don't yet have a login on the advent blog, please tell me your
email address so that I can send you an invitation.</p>

<p>Perl 6 advent blog posts should be finished the day before they are
due, and published with midnight (UTC) of the due date as publishing date.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, or want to discuss blog post ideas, please join
on the #perl6 IRC channel on irc.freenode.org, or drop me an email at
moritz.lenz@gmail.com.</p>
