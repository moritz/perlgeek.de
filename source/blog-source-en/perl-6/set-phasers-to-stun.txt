Set Phasers to Stun!
<!-- 1259190000 -->

<p>Did you ever wonder how <code>BEGIN</code>, <code>CHECK</code>,
<code>END</code> and so on are called in Perl? Well, they didn't have a good
name, until <a
href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2009-11-06#i_1695188">recently</a>.</p>

<p>The PerlÂ 6 spec listed them under <em>closure traits</em>, which is
unwieldy, and not really exact either. <a
href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=29004">Now they are called
<em>phasers</em></a>, because they tell you which execution phase the block or
statement runs in.</p>

<p>There are so many possible puns that I'll refrain from writing any.</p>
