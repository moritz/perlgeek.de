Second Grant Report: Structured Error Messages
<!-- 1306045701 -->
<p>Progress on my <a
href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2011/02/hague-grant-application-struct.html">grant
for error message</a> is slower than expected, as expected :-). Life and work,
though rewarding, take their toll. Also many of my original ideas turned out
to be not very good, and got shot down by @Larry (with good reason).</p>

<p>However I did get around to lay out some specification for exceptions in <a
href="https://github.com/perl6/specs/blob/master/S32-setting-library/Exception.pod">S32::Exception</a>
(<a href="http://design.perl6.org/S32/Exception.html">rendered</a>) - some
basic roles, and the relationships between exception, <code>Failure</code>
(lazy/unthrown exceptions) and backtraces.</p>

<p>More importantly I think I'm at a point where I could start to actually
implement some of that stuff, and use that experience to update the
specification.</p>
