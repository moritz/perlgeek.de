PVC - Perl 6 Vocabulary Coach
<!-- 1289328346 -->

<p>Hej!</p>

<p>I'm trying to learn Norwegian these days, which is eating many of my <a
href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/round_tuit">round tuits</a> that were
previously available for Perl 6 hacking.</p>

<p>On the other hand I'm using Perl 6 to help me learning; I've written <a
href="https://github.com/moritz/perl6-vocabular-coach">PVC, the Perl 6
Vocabulary Coach</a>. It uses a word list, and keeps track of how many times
in a row I entered the Norwegian translation of a word correctly.</p>

<p>The better I know a word, the less frequently I'm being asked for it. Not
quite the same as <a
href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/edu/55/5/297/">spaced repetition
learning</a>, but still it feels quite well.</p>
