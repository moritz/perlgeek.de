Gabor: Keep going
<!-- 1279571765 -->

<p>After reading <a
href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2010/07/promoting-perl-is-fun.html">this
blog post</a>, I just want to say: keep going.</p>

<p>Gabor does really awesome things for Perl (and especially for Perl 6, which
I tend to notice more): beginner's tutorials, screencasts, training courses,
writes an IDE and so on. If his primary interest was his own success, his
priorities would be quite different.</p>

<p>I hope that Gabor doesn't pay too much attention to the hostilities from
parts of the Perl community, and I wish him and us all the best for his <a

project</a>.</p>
