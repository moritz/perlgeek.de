Perl 6 By Example, Another Perl 6 Book
<!-- 2016-11-19 -->

<p>I'm taking a shot a writing a Perl 6 book. Let's see how this goes.</p>

<p>My working title is <em>Perl 6 by Example</em>, and I want to recycle the
approach taken in <a href="https://github.com/perl6/book">Using Perl 6</a> to introduce
topics by example. Contrary to the now abandoned previous effort, I want to
introduce the examples in small chunks, developing and explaining them bit by
bit.</p>

<p>I expect the result to be rather limited in size (maybe 70 to 100 pages), and
not a comprehensive guide to the Perl 6 language, but enough to get you
started.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>

<p>The reader should have previous programming experience. I assume familiarity
with conditionals, variables, loops and basic data types such as various
numbers, strings and lists. Some OO concepts such as classes, instances and
methods will also be assumed, but I will drop some clarifying words about how
I use the terminology.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>I will follow roughly the same process as in <a href="https://deploybook.com/">my previous
book</a>: First I write blog posts about the topics I
intend to cover, and later distill them into chapters.</p>

<p>When I have some significant portion of the manuscript available, I will
<a href="https://leanpub.com/perl6">pre-publish it  on  Leanpub</a>, and start to sell
it.</p>

<p>If there is a lot of interest, I might investigate options to publish it in
print form.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p>Luckily, several people have offered to help in some form or another,
typically by writing or proof-reading (in no particular order):</p>

<ul>
<li>[ptc]</li>
<li>DrForr</li>
<li>Coke</li>
<li>tbowder</li>
<li>AlexDaniel</li>
<li>seatek</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing the warm and helpful nature of the Perl 6 community, it is likely that
more folks will step up to help. Any help, as well co-authors, will be highly
appreciated.</p>

<h2>Other Perl 6 Books</h2>

<p>Information on other Perl 6 book projects is rather sparse and vague. I try my
best to keep informed about these projects.</p>

<ul>
<li>Laurent Rosenfeld <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/557m4k/any_new_perl_6_books/d8aokjq/">is working on a
book</a>
which is basically a Perl 6 version of <a href="http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/">Think
Python</a>. It is targeted at
programming beginners, and has been accepted by a well-respected publisher.</li>
<li>There are rumors that Larry Wall is writing a <em>Programming Perl 6</em> book,
and I wish that to be true. I know nothing about the progress or time
horizon of that project.</li>
<li>brian d foy has started a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1422827986/learning-perl-6">kickstarter to fund his project to write "Learning
Perl 6"</a>.
Since "Learning Perl" is a book focused on beginners with no prior programming
experience, I assume the same is true for the Perl 6 version of this book,
so I don't see much competition between his and mind project, and wish him
luck and success.</li>
<li>Ken Youens-Clark has written <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/book/kyclark/metagenomics/details">about metagenomics, a subset of bioinformatics</a>, using Perl 6 example code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interested?</h2>

<p>If you are interested in progress updates or milestones about my book project,
please sign up for the mailing list below. It will be low volume (probably
less than one email per month). I will also try
my best to inform you about news of the other Perl 6 book projects.</p>

<p>Numerous signups will also boost my motivation to work on the book.</p>
