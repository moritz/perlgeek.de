This Week's Contribution to Perl 6 Week 11: Improve an error message for Hyper Operators
<!-- 1287321266 -->

<p>For this week's contribution to Perl 6 we ask you to improve the error
message that Hyper Operators emit when lists are not of equal length.</p>

<p>(<a
    href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/contribute-now-announce.html">Introduction
    to this series of challenges</a>)</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>In Perl 6, operators can be applied to lists; in one version, the lists
must be of equal length, in the other form one or more lists are automatically
repeated to be of proper length.</p>

<pre>[% syntax perl6 %]
# equal length required:
say join ', ', (1, 2, 3) >>+<< (10, 20, 30);
# output: 11, 22, 33

# auto-extending the right side by
# turning the less-then/larger-then signs around:
say join ', ', (1, 2, 3) >>+>> 10;
# output: 11, 12, 13

# this correctly produces an error message
(1, 2, 3) >>+<< (1, 2)
# output: Sorry, sides are of uneven length and not dwimmy.

# recurses into structures
((1, 2, [3, 4]) >>+<< (10, 10, [20, 20])).perl
#output: [11, 12, [23, 24]]
[% endsyntax %]</pre>

<h2>What you can do</h2>

<p>Please submit a patch that improves the error message. A good better error
message would be:</p>

<pre>[% syntax escape %]
# for non-recursive structures:
Sorry, structures on both sides of non-dwimmy hyperop are not of same shape
  left:  3 elements
  right: 2 elements

# for recursive structures:
Sorry, structures on both sides of non-dwimmy hyperop are not of same shape
  left:  3 elements
  right: 2 elements
at nesting level 2
[% endsyntax %]</pre>

<p>The source code can be found in <a
    href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/metaops.pm#L48">src/core/metaops.pm</a>,
spread out over a few multi subs.</p>

<p>You'll need to introduce another (probably named) parameter or a contextual
variable to track the recursion depth.</p>

<h2>Submission</h2>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I have received one submission, worked a bit on it
and included it in Rakudo.</p>

<p>Please submit your patch to the <a
href="mailto:perl6-compiler@perl.org">perl6-compiler@perl.org</a> mailing
list (and put moritz@faui2k3.org on CC,
because the mailing list sometimes lags quite a bit).</p>

<p>If you have any questions, feel free to send them to the mailing list, or
ask <a href="http://perl6.org/community/irc">on our IRC channel"</a>.</p>
