Perl 6 Tidings from October 2009
<!-- 1256851013 -->

<p>These tidings posts seem to become rather sparse, but I hope you get some
news by reading the <a href="http://planetsix.perl.org/">Planet Six</a> feed
aggregator anyway.</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Larry lifted up the dual nature of Ranges. They mostly serve as an
    interval now, for smart iteration the series operator has been pimped up.
    You can now write <code> for 1, 3 ... *+2, 9 { .say }</code> to print all
    the odd numbers between 1 and 9. (<a
            href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=28344">r28344</a>,
            <a
            href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=28348">r28348</a>,
            <a href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=28351">r28351</a>).</li>
    <li><code>Rat</code>ional and Complex types now have their own literals
    (<a href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=28173">r28173</a>).</li>
    <li>Stubbed classes are now documented (<a
            href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=28196">r28196</a>,
            <a href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=28197">r28197</a>).</li>
    <li>The new <a href="http://design.perl6.org/S08.html">S08</a> documents
    Parcels and Captures.</li>
    <li>The numeric types have been cleaned up a lot (<a href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=28502">r28502</a> and later commits
    up to <a href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=28597">r28597</a>).</li>
    <li>New and improved signature introspection (<a
            href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=28664">r28664</a>,
            <a href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=28665">r28665</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compilers</h2>

<h3>Rakudo</h3>

<p>As opposed to two months ago, Rakudo now</p>

<ul>
    <li>supports the Rat type</li>
    <li>supports overloading of many built-in operators</li>
    <li>has contextual variables</li>
    <li>has a faster and much better signature binder</li>
    <li>supports all kind of trigonometric functions, including on complex
    numbers</li>
    <li>implements sophisticated signature introspection</li>
</ul>

<p>Patrick Michaud is also working on a new tool named npq-rx, which combines
a self-hosting NQP compiler and a new regex engine, which already supports
proto regexes, NQP code assertions and closures, and is generally much faster
and better than PGE.</p>

<h3>Sprixel</h3>

<p>Mathew Wilson aka diakopter started <a
href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/announcing-sprixel.writeback">sprixel</a>,
a PerlÂ 6 to Javascript compiler.</p>

<h3>Mildew</h3>
<p>Mildew now has an experimental javascript emitter.</p>

<h2>Other matters</h2>

<p><a href="http://perl6.org/">perl6.org</a> is redesigned again, this time
spanning multiple pages, thus allowing much more stuff to be linked there.</p>

<p>Four Perl 6 and Rakudo hackers <a
href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/we-write-a-perl-6-book-for-you.writeback">announced
that they are writing a Perl 6 book</a>, the print release of which shall
coincide with the release of Rakudo Star.</p>
