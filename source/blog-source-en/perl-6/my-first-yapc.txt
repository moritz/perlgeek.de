My first YAPC - YAPC::EU 2010 in Pisa
<!-- 1281105427 -->

<p>This week I attended my first international Perl conference, the <a
href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ye2010/index.html">YAPC::EU 2010 in
Pisa, Italy</a>. I very much enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I arrived a few days earlier, and spent the time visiting Pisa, talking
with old and new friends, and did some collaborative hacking. I especially
enjoyed meeting people with whom I had had only contact via Internet so far,
and found all of them to be very nice in meat space.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the day before the conference started officially, a group of
Perl 6 hackers met and discussed topics around Perl 6 and Rakudo. I recall
talking with Patrick Michaud, Jonathan Worthington, Carl Mäsak, Paweł
Murias, Gabor Szabo, smash (I can't spell his full name correctly from memory,
sorry for that), and we have a very productive discussion (about 5 hours or
so). Notes from the discussion will be published later.</p>

<p>On Wednesday the actual conference started, and there were plenty of very
interesting talks, and very amusing lightning talks. I generally like the
humor that is widespread in the Perl community.</p>

<p>On Thursday I continued to attend nice and informative talks, and also gave
a talk on my own. It was about physical modelling with Perl 6, and in general
the feedback was very positive, and somebody even commented that while he
didn't understand everything I wrote, it reminded him that it was important to
learn Perl 6 now. Win \o/. (There was also some criticism, but from somebody
who apparently hasn't read <a
href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ye2010/talk/2949">the abstract</a>;
the "write-only" meme seems to apply to perl bloggers, not code). You can find
<a href="http://perlgeek.de/talks/2010/yapceu-p6-realworld/">the slides
to my talk here.</a></p>

<p>Firday was the day of my departure too - sadly I had to leave after the
first talk, and missed the rest of the day, including the closing keynote by
mst (I did attend a talk of his) and the traditional auction.</p>

<p>I especially enjoyed...</p>

<ul>
    <li>meeting Patrick, Larry, Gloria, Aaron, Gabor and many others for the
    first time in real-life</li>
    <li>a thorough, high-bandwith discussion with Larry, Jonathan, Patrick and
    Carl about p6 spec questions, and the Perl 6 discussions mentioned
    earlier</li>
    <li>a lightning talk <em>imagine you're in a data center with no
    connection to the outside, and you accidentally executed <code>chmod -x
    chmod</code>. What would you do?</em></li>
    <li>good Italian Pizzas (although I had to wait 50 minutes for one of
    them)</li>
<!--    <li>discovering that the cable connection in the hotel did not block
TCP port 53</li> -->
    <li>A talk by Tim Bunce, where he demonstrated database access in Perl 6
    both with libraries that do native calls, and through the Blizkost project
    using the Perl 5 DBI/DBD::SQLite modules</li>
    <li>the general relaxed attitude in the Perl community, where people help
    each other, and don't seem to be easily offended (at least in meat space
    :)</li>
    <li>being surrounded by many other geeks</li>
    <li>realizing that several Perl hackers brought their family to the
    conference</li>
</ul>

<p>It was an overwhelming experience, and I look forward to my next YAPC!</p>
