Recent Perl 6 Developments August 2008
<!-- 1219269600 -->
<p>There are two major, recent improvements in Perl 6 development:</p>

<p>Patrick Michaud implemented pre-compiled modules for Rakudo. Precompiling
<code>Test.pm</code> greatly reduced the time for running the test suite.
The time for <code>make spectest_regression</code> was reduced from 8 minutes
20 seconds to 2 minutes 40 seconds on my PC.</p>

<p>Larry Wall has been working on his Parser for Perl 6 (called STD.pm). It
can now parse all of the test suite, and even can add operators on the fly.
This week Larry added symbol tables, which means that STD.pm now detects
undeclared subs and variables as well as constructs that were missing, and
were errornously parsed as sub calls.</p>

<p>This already helped to fix quite some tests in the test suite.</p>
[% option no-header %] [% option no-footer %]
