Why was the Perl 6 Advent Calendar such a Success?
<!-- 1261782000 -->

<p>I think it's not too bold to call the <a
href="http://perl6advent.wordpress.com/">PerlÂ 6 Advent Calendar</a> a full
success: over 40k page views, more than 150 non-spam comments, and lots of
new faces and nicknames in #perl6 - it's been a very pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>I asked myself why it became such a success, and came up with this list of
things:</p>

<h3>Limited in Scope</h3>

<p>24 days are over rather quickly, so everyone who contributes knows when the
deed is done</p>

<h3>It appeals to very different contributors</h3>

<p>Some people like the shiny new regex and grammar features, others are
interested in the object model, operator overloading or complex numbers.
Since we had no fixed topics, everybody could choose a topic that played to
their strengths.</p>

<h3>Each task is small and well limited</h3>

<p>Writing a good post about a topic you know takes about half an hour up to
an hour, maybe two if you need to do some research on the topic. Either way
it's a relatively small task (compared to "write a regex engine" or "redesign
the build system of $compiler" or so).</p>

<h3>Schedule and polite nagging</h3>

<p>We had a schedule for each day, and people could add their name to a free
slot. When the day approached, the other authors started to ask politely how
it was progressing, making sure people did not forget their posts. Also
authors felt the subtle pressure to finish their posts on time.</p>

<h3>Lots of positive feedback</h3>

<p>We had lots of feedback, most of it quite positive: blog comments, visitors
in our IRC channel, being featured on slashdot. That was very encouraging.</p>

<p>Also other authors would preview and proof-read the posts before they were
published, pointing out falsities and gems.</p>

<h3>We had a driving force</h3>

<p>PerlJam and colomon took care. The decided to make the advent calendar
happen, set up a blog, discussed things and so on - they made it happen.</p>

<hr />

<p>All these factors encouraged contributions. I don't think all of them are
necessary for a successful, lively projects, but they certainly help.</p>

<p>What other factors do you know that encourage contribution in open-source
projects? What could we have done even better?</p>
