My personal "I want a PONIE" wish list for Rakudo Star
<!-- 1274773657 -->

<p>In June we'll see a special Rakudo release codenamed <a
href="http://use.perl.org/~pmichaud/journal/39411">Rakudo Star</a>. I've done
some development with and of Rakudo, and here's the list of features and bug
fixes that I think are essential for a successful and well-received
release:<p>

<ul>
    <li>Backtraces with Perl 6 file names and line numbers (Update 2010-05-30:
    jnthn implemented those)</li>
    <li>Proper closure cloning (Update 2010-06-07: pmichaud has fixed it)</li>
    <li>Match objects which return Perl 6 (and not parrot) data structures
    (Update 2010-05-30: pmichaud laid the foundations for that, and I got it
    to a "good enough" state).</li>
    <li><code>/&lt;foo&gt;/</code> should pick up a regex named
    <code>foo</code> from the lexical scope, not only from method lookup.</li>
    <li>Using the same list or iterator twice returned from <code>map</code> or
    <code>gather/take</code> should work (Update: pmichaud fixed that in The
    Big List Refactor, which was merged shortly before the 2010.06 release).</li>
</ul>

<p>Other things that I consider nice to have, but not essential:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>$/</code> should be available in the RHS of
    <code>s///</code> (seems hard to do with current Parrot semantics)</li>
    <li><code>use</code> currently only accepts pairs, not proper argument
    lists. Would be nice to have that.</li>
    <li>General Whatever-currying (ie <code>* op 3</code> returns a
    closure of type WhateverCode) (Update: jnthn <a
    href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/4293e0722d05267accd66fe6ce312bee1f7a3e22">implemented
    it</a> one or two days after this blog post)</li>
    <li>Currently user-defined operators hide candidates of the same name from
    outer scopes. This is rather annoying.</li>
</ul>
