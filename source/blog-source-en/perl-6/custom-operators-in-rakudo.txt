Custom operators in Rakudo
<!-- 1242337063 -->

<p>Last night <a href="http://pmichaud.com/">Patrick Michaud</a> implemented
a few nice features in Rakudo: you can now refer to operators by their 
sub names, define custom operators and overload existing operators.</p>

<p>It comes with a few caveats (precedence levels and associativity are not
yet implemented, and some operators that are parrot primitives don't work too
well as subs), but all in all it's very nice to see this in action:</p>

<pre>[% syntax escape %]
sub postfix:<!>(Int $x) {
    [*] 1..$x
}

say 5!;         # 120
[% endsyntax %]</pre>
