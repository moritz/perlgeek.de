Is Perl 6 really Perl?
<!-- 1258026641 -->

<p>A few days ago <a href="http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal/39861">masak
blogged about the social aspect</a> of the <em>is Perl 6 really Perl?</em>
question.</p>

<p>He presumes that the answer is <em>yes</em>, but doesn't tell us why.
I'll try to give some reasons.</p>

<h2>Perl 6 started as the successor to Perl 5</h2>

<p>Perl 6 <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-meta@perl.org/msg00409.html">started
off as the successor to Perl 5, at a Perl 5 meeting</a>, by the Perl
crowd. It was a plan to escape both the backwards compatibility trap (which
meant that broken things couldn't be fixed without many people yelling), and
the lack of momentum in the community.</p>

<h2>Perl 6 embraces the Perl philosophy</h2>

<p>What makes Perl Perl? In my opinion it's not the sigils on variables that
make Perl Perl, or that writing a regex only need two characters and so on.
It's mostly the philosophy that makes the difference.</p>

<p>There are some underlying principles like TIMTOWTDI, context sensitivity,
convenience over consistency, making simple things easy and hard things
possible, often used constructs short and less frequent things longer, and so
on.</p>

<p>Perl 6 is founded on all those philosophies and ideals, and also shares
some technical principles. For example sigils on variables (oh, I mentioned
them already ...), easy access to powerful regexes, that fact that operations
coerce their arguments (instead of the type of arguments determining the
operation like in javascript, where a <code>+</code> can either mean addition
or string concatenation).</p>

<p>So if you agree with my definition of what makes Perl Perl, Perl 6 is also
Perl. If not, please tell me what's the essence of Perl!</p>
