An offer for software developers: free IRC logging
<!-- 1297099243 -->

<p>The <a href="http://perl6.org/">Perl 6 developers</a> communicate a lot
through <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr>. Some of the conversation
is still valuable later on, so we have <a
    href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/today">public IRC logs</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://moritz.faui2k3.org/en/ilbot">software powering these
logs</a> was written especially for #perl6, but works fine for other channels
too. Among the other users are <a href="http://www.testml.org/">TestML</a>,
<a
href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cdk/index.php?title=Main_Page">CDK
(Chemistry Development Kit)</a>, <a href="http://darcs.net/">darcs</a>,
<a href="http://mojolicio.us/">mojo</a>, <a
href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre, the Perl IDE</a>, <a
href="http://www.parrot.org/">Parrot</a> and <a
href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Welcome_to_Rosetta_Code">Rosetta
Code</a>.</p>

<p>If you are also developing software, and would like public logs for your
channel (either on freenode or irc.perl.org; other servers might be added on
demand), feel free to contact me (<code>moritz_</code> on freenode, or per
email: moritz at faui2k3.org)</p>

<p>Features include: linking to individual lines, permanent URLs and volatile
URLs for the current day, automatic linking of URLs and readable color
schemes.</p>

<p>A current limitation is that you can't have two channels with the same name
from different networks, in case of conflict "first come, first served"
holds.</p>
