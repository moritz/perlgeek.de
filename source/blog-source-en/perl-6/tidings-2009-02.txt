Perl 6 Tidings from February 2009
<!-- 1234738800 -->
<p>A lot of things has happened since the last <a
href="/blog-en/perl-6/tidings-2009-01.html">tidings post</a>: lots of
spec cleanup, Rakudo left the nest, there's an easy-to-install version
of elf, and lots of small improvements.</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>Mark Lentczner worked on updating his <a
href="http://www.ozonehouse.com/mark/periodic/">"Periodic Table of the [Perl
6] Operators"</a> and asked many questions about operator parsing, meta
operators, associativity and related subjects. It appears that some of
these questions triggered Larry's dislike for the current situation,
which in turn led to many improvements.</p>

<p>The most user visible effect is certainly that the cross-meta
operator which used to be <code>XopX</code> is now just
<code>Xop</code>, and there's a new prefix-metaoperator for infix
operators that reverses the order of arguments. So sorting with
reversed string comparison now can be written as
<code>@array.sort(&amp;infix&lt;Rleg&gt;)</code>.</p>

<p>Jerry "particle" Gay continued his steady improvements of the S19
draft, and eliminated some Perl5isms. I submitted my notes about
built-in testing to p6l, which started a lively and interesting
discussion. I'm still digesting its results in the background.</p>

<h2>Implementations</h2>

<h3>Rakudo</h3>

<p>Rakudo <a href="/blog-en/perl-6/where-rakudo-lives.txt">left the
nest and now lives on github</a>. Since Patrick Michaud was occupied
with real-life worries right after the move we had some time with
uncertainty about the current state; but the community recovered
quickly, and although we still see traces of the fallout here and
there, most things work again, and development has continued.</p>

<p>Most notably Jonathan Worthington made two days worth of bugfixes
to decimate the <code>perl6</code> queue, which Carl Mäsak had tirelessly
populated to over 250 open bug reports. Also Chris Dolan implemented
the <code>make</code> builtin, which sets the scalar portion of a
Match object.</p>

<p>This Tuesday we will see the release of Parrot 0.9.1, the first
release that doesn't come with Rakudo bundled. After that Rakudo will
have its own release schedule, although the details aren't out
yet.</p>

<h3>Elf</h3>

<p>Mitchell Charity developed a branch of his <i>elf</i> compiler
<a href="http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/misc/elfish/gimme_elf">that's
very easy to get to run</a>: just change to its directory and type
<code>make</code>.</p>

<h3>Smop</h3>

<p>Daniel Ruoso sent a very verbose update to his TPF grant manager; I
haven't yet seen it published. But if you follow <a
href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/">the TPF blog</a> you'll
probably see it appear very soon, and it'll be loads better than
anything I could try to write about smop.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Carl Mäsak bemoaned the non-existence of user level documentation
for Perl 6, and decided to start the <a
href="http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/docs/u4x">Userdocs for Christmas
(u4x)</a> project. It's still mostly in the planning phase, although
there are some glossary entries in there.</p>

<h2>Packaging</h2>

<p>This past month we've run into the situation were we wanted to move
libraries out of the projects in which they were developed, in order
to share them among other projects. Since CPAN.pm can't handle Perl 6
code, dependencies and appropriate directory structures, and no other
solution was in sight. So it was again Carl who lost his patience (and
remember, impatience is one of the three virtues of the Perl
programmer) and wrote <a
href="http://github.com/masak/proto">proto</a>, a simple script that
downloads and installs Parrot, Rakudo, and various Perl 6
libraries.</p>
