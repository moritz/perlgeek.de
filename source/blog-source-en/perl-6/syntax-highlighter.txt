A Syntax Highlighter for Perl 6
<!-- 1225148400 -->
<p>Ahmed Zawawi implemented my <a
href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.users/2008/07/msg788.html">idea
from June 2008</a> and wrote a <a
href="http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/src/perl6/STD_syntax_highlight">STD.pm
based syntax highlighter</a> for Perl 6.</p>

<p>It doesn't work very well for comments and POD (because they are parsed as
whitespaces by STD.pm and thus don't appear in the parse tree at all), but
apart from that <a
href="http://feather.perl6.nl/~azawawi/html/S12-class/anonymous.t.html">it
works very nicely (example here)</a>.</p>

<p>(The current heuristic for comments is that most of them happen at the
<code>statement_list</code> level, so that is coloured blue, and everything
else has different colours).</p>

<p>And it's more than a syntax highlighter: If you have javascript enabled,
you can click on the "Show syntax tree" button. Then when you move the mouse
over the text you'll see the length of current token and the path through the
parse tree that led to it. That already helped to identify at least two
mis-parses in STD.pm.</p>

<p>There's also a <a href="http://feather.perl6.nl/~azawawi/html/">directory
of syntax-highlighted test files</a> where you can see some more output of the
syntax highlighter.</p>
