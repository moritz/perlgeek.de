The Perl Survey and Perl 6
<!-- 1274344538 -->
<p>Today I've participated in <a href="http://perl.websurvey.net.au/">The Perl
Survey</a>, and I want to encourage you to do the same.</p>

<p>I was a bit disappointed that the list of Perl versions didn't include any
Perl 6 - which I use sufficiently to mark that option if it existed.</p>

<p>It's a sad fact that parts of the Perl community haven't realized that
PerlÂ 6 is more than a dream, but comes <a href="http://rakudo.org/">with
programs you can run today</a>. Association with or funding from TPF doesn't
seem to make you immune to that misconception.</p>
