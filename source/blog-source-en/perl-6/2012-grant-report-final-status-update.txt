Exceptions Grant Report -- Final update
<!-- 1338918568 -->

<p>In my <a
href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/2012-grant-report-exceptions-may.html">previous
blog post</a> I mentioned that I'm nearly done with my <a
href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2011/02/hague-grant-application-struct.html">exceptions
Hague grant</a>. I have since done all the things that I identified as still
missing.</p>

<p>In particular I <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?ack">ack</a>
through the setting for remaining uses of <code>die</code>, and the only thing
left are internal errors, error messages about not-yet-implemented things and
the actual declaration of <code>die</code>. Which means that everything that
should be a typed exception is now.</p>

<p>The error catalogue can be found in <a
href="http://design.perl6.org/S32/Exception.html">S32::Exception</a>.
Documentation for <a
href="https://github.com/perl6/mu/blob/master/docs/exceptions.pod">compiler
writers is in a separate document</a>, and the promised <a
href="https://github.com/perl6/roast/blob/master/packages/Test/Util.pm#L177">documentation
for test authors is in the POD of Test::Util</a> in the "roast"
repository.</p>

<p>Now I wait for review of my work by the grant manager (thanks Will) and the
grant committee.</p>

<p>I'd like to thank everybody who was involved with the grant.</p>
