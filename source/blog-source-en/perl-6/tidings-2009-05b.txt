Perl 6 Tidings from May 2009 (second iteration)
<!-- 1242684000 -->

<p>Shortly before my vacations (Ferie i Norge!) I want summarize
what happened in Perl 6 land.</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>Many small corrections improved the consistency of the
specification, but the biggest area of development was the
language mutability and interaction of various languages.</p>

<p>There are various dialects that inherit some of the main language's
syntactic features, but are quite different: quotes, regexes, quasi
quotes (for macros), transliterations etc. Those are now called
<em>slang</em>s, and for example declaring a new backslash assertion
in a regex now works like this (r26734):</p>

<pre>[% syntax escape %]
augment slang Regex {
    token backslash:sym<y> { y\w+ }
}
[% endsyntax %]</pre>

<p>The various slangs are available via the <code>~</code> twigil, for
example <code>$~Regex</code> refers to the current braid of the
<code>Regex</code> slang (r26733).</p>


<h2>Implementations</h2>
<h3>Rakudo</h3>

<p>There were, as usual, many activities in Rakudo. Jonathan
Worthington finished his Hague grant on the multi dispatcher and
object orientation, and applied for a new one, covering (among other
features) parallel dispatch (of the form
<code>@array&gt;&gt;.method(@args)</code>) and user defined
traits. He started his work already (and seems to have finished a good
part already), even though the grant committee
hasn't yet approved.</p>

<p>He also implemented much nicer error message: they now contain a
stack trace of the Perl 6 functions only (used to be also internal subs),
and each position in the call chain is annotated  with file name and
line number. This brings Rakudo an important step closer to
real-world usability.</p>

<p>Patrick Michaud implemented basic parsing of the <code>«...»</code>
quotes, fixed some Unicode issues, and <a
href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/custom-operators-in-rakudo.html">implemented
operator definitions and overloading</a> (things like precedence and
associativity are still missing, but it's very impressive
nonetheless).</p>

<p>chromatic tirelessly optimized Parrot and Rakudo startup (Rakudo
startup used to be about one second) with good success.</p>

<p>Stephen "Tene" Weeks put Rakudo into its own high level language
(HLL) namespace, which is Parrot's tool to avoid leakage of Parrot
symbols into Perl 6's namespaces, and to simplify interaction with
other languages. Sadly this make Rakudo a bit slow, eliminating about
half of chromatic's speed improvements.</p>

<h3>SMOP</h3>

<p>Paweł Murias continued the refactoring of smop and mildew, working
(as far as I can tell) on attributes, method signatures and control
exceptions.</p>


<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>


<h3>Smartlinks</h3>

<p>Gabor Szabo released the smartlinks utility as <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/perlodc?Text::SmartLinks">Text::Smartlinks</a>
to CPAN, and implemented the linking to the various S32 documents, and
published a keyword index to the synopsis documents.</p>

<h3>Test suite</h3>

<p>In the test suite there are 50 to 60 files (with a total of about
230 tests) left that are under
consideration/review to moved into <code>t/spec/</code>, the
official part of the test suite.</p>

<p>Commit activity in the test suite:</p>

<p>(The last spike is caused by me using git-svn. Every other weekend
I'm offline and do some work on the test suite. With svn that resulted
in one huge commit, with git-svn that results in many more smaller
commits.)</p>

<p>I did some useless statistics on who committed how much, and found
that there were twelve hackers who had at least 100 commits to the
test suite each:</p>

<table summary="number of commits per contributor">
    <tr> <th># Commits</th>  <th>Nick</th> </tr>
    <tr> <td>1259 </td><td> moritz   </td></tr>
    <tr> <td> 916 </td><td> audreyt  </td></tr>
    <tr> <td> 548 </td><td> iblech   </td></tr>
    <tr> <td> 279 </td><td> lwall    </td></tr>
    <tr> <td> 230 </td><td> jnthn    </td></tr>
    <tr> <td> 212 </td><td> pmichaud </td></tr>
    <tr> <td> 152 </td><td> corion   </td></tr>
    <tr> <td> 148 </td><td> agentz   </td></tr>
    <tr> <td> 145 </td><td> putter   </td></tr>
    <tr> <td> 123 </td><td> Stevan   </td></tr>
    <tr> <td> 117 </td><td> cosimo   </td></tr>
    <tr> <td> 107 </td><td> Auzon    </td></tr>
</table>

<p>We had commits from 132 different accounts in the test suite.</p>
