A shiny perl6.org site
<!-- 1251320644 -->

<p>I'm very pleased to announce that <a href="http://perl6.org/">perl6.org</a>
now got a shiny new face - the one that <a
href="http://sushee.schreibsturm.org/">Su-Shee</a> developed for
perl6-projects.org. I'd also like to thank <a
href="http://www.dwright.org/">Daniel Wright</a>, owner of the perl6.org
domain, for making that domain available to us.</p>

<p>The story behind it is as simple as amazing: I noticed that we had no good,
up to date overview of what PerlÂ 6 projects existed out there. So I bought the
domain perl6-projects.org, put up a few lists of different projects - and gave
it a rather bad design. Because I may be decent with programming, blogging and
explaining things, but as a designer I simply suck.</p>


<p>But what I did was sticking the source code into a public repository (the
pugs repository, to be exact) to which it is very easy to gain access, and
made the server pull from that repository every 15 minutes. So basically
everybody who wanted could update the site.</p>

<p>And lo and behold, four month later Su-Shee contributed a nice design,
which we modified in small things based on feedback from #perl6.</p>

<p>Slowly it dawned to me (and others probably) that this site had the
potential to be much larger in scope than a simple project list - it could
evolve into the central web site for Perl 6 developers and users. With the
small caveat that <code>perl6.org</code> would have been a much nicer domain
name - but it was taken already.</p>

<p>But the whois entry gave us hope - it belongs to Daniel Wright, and a quick
google search turned up that he's a perl monger, organizer and attendee of YAPC
conferences. So we decided that pmichaud should contact him, being more of an
authority in Perl 6 land than me.</p>

<p>After a few exchanged mails we found out that Daniel's and our goals matched,
so about one day later he changed the DNS to the same IP that
perl6-projects.org uses, I added another alias to the virtual host, and we
were done.</p>

<p>It's a prime example both for attracting contributors, and for what you can
reach by simply talking to people. Thanks to everyone involved.</p>
