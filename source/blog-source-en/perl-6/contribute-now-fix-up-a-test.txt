This Week's Contribution to Perl 6 Week 2: Fix up a test
<!-- 1273567472 -->

<p>For this week's contribution to Perl 6 we ask you to fix a short test file
in the official spec tests.</p>

<p>(<a
    href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/contribute-now-announce.html">Introduction
    to this series of challenges</a>)</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The test file <a
href="http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/t/spec/S05-grammar/parse_and_parsefile.t?p=30613">in
S05-grammar/parse_and_parsefile.t</a> tests the<code>.parse</code> and
<code>.parsefile</code> methods of custom grammars.</p>

<p>However, it uses the outdated assumption that <code>Grammar.parse</code>
automatically searches for a match in a string, just like a regex match does.
That's not the case anymore; The current specification says that
<code>.parse</code> is anchored to the beginning and end of the string, which
means it always parses the entire string, or nothing at all.</p>

<h2>What you can do</h2>

<p>Update the test file to reflect the current specification, so that the
parse and parsefile methods match the whole test string.</p>

<p>In the old version the test made sure that only the correct submatch was
found; please replace that by a test for a non-matching grammar or test
string.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo Perl 6 compiler</a> implements the
parse and parsefile method. Please run your test file on Rakudo, and make sure
it runs on Rakudo. Bonus points if you can finde a bug in Rakudo's parse or
parsefile methods, and add another test that demonstrates the bug.
(Disclaimer: I have no knowledge of such a bug; there might not be one at all).</p>

<h2>Submission</h2>

<p>For this challenge please join the <a
href="http://perl6.org/community/irc">#perl6 IRC channel</a>, and ask for a
commit bit to the test suite. You'll need to tell us your desired nick name
and email address for the SVN user account.</p>

<p>When you build Rakudo <a href="http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo">by
following these instructions</a>, run <code>make spectest</code>. This
will automatically checkout out a copy of the test into the <code>t/spec<code>
subdirectory of your rakudo directory.</p>

<p>Edit <code>t/spec/S05-grammar/parse_and_parsefile.t</code>, and then test
it by running</p>

<pre>
make t/spec/S05-grammar/parse_and_parsefile.t
# if you need more diagnostic output, also run
./perl6 t/spec/S05-grammar/parse_and_parsefile.rakudo
</pre>


<p>Once you have the test file passing and correct, change to the
<code>t/spec</code> directory, and commit your changes:</p>

<pre>
svn ci -m '[t/spec] bring parse_and_parsefile.t up to date' S05-grammar/parse_and_parsefile.t
</pre>

<p>If you need any guidance, please don't hesitate to ask us either on IRC, or
through the perl6-compiler@perl.org mailing list.</p>
