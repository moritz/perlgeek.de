Stop The Rewrites!
<!-- 1342543924 -->
<p>What follows is a rant. If you're not in the mood to read a rant right now,
please stop and come back in an hour or two.</p>

<p>The Internet is full of people who know better than you how to manage
your open source project, even if they only know some bits and pieces about
it. News at 11.</p>

<p>But there is one particular instance of that advice that I hear often
applied to <a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo Perl 6</a>: <a
href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=982243">Stop the rewrites</a>.</p>

<p>To be honest, I can fully understand the sentiment behind that advice.
People see that it has taken us several years to get where we are now, and in
their opinion, that's too long. And now we shouldn't waste our time with
rewrites, but get the darn thing running already!</p>

<p>But Software development simply doesn't work that way. Especially not if
your target is moving, as is Perl 6. (Ok, Perl 6 isn't moving that much
anymore, but there are still areas we don't understand very well, so our
current understanding of Perl 6 is a moving target).</p>

<p>At some point or another, you realize that with your current design, you
can only pile workaround on top of workaround, and hope that the whole thing
never collapses.</p>

<p>Those people who spread the good advice to never do any major rewrites
again, they never address what you <b>should</b> do when you face such a
situation. Build the tower of workarounds even higher, and pray to Cthulhu
that you can build it robust enough to support a whole stack of third-party
modules?</p>

<p>Curiously this piece of advice occasionally comes from people who otherwise
know a thing or two about software development methodology. Must be some kind
of cognitive dissonance.</p>
