New Perl 6 community server now live, accepting signups
<!-- 1418231164 -->
<p>The <a href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/2014-community-server-funding.html">new Perl 6 community server</a> is now alive and kicking.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/2014-community-server-update.html">planned</a>, I've set up KVM virtualization, and so far there are two guest systems. <em>hack.p6c.org</em> is meant for general Perl 6 development activity (which also includes irssi/weechat sessions), and is equipped with 20GB RAM to handle multiple concurrent rakudo-jvm compilations :-). It runs a pretty bare-bones Debian Jessie.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> there is now a <a href="http://www.p6c.org/">website for the new server</a>.</p>

<p><em>www.p6c.org</em> is the web server where I plan to host perl6.org and related (sub-)domains. It's not as beefy as <em>hack</em>, but sufficiently large to compile and run Rakudo, in preparation for future Perl 6-based web hosting. Currently I'm running a copy of several perl6.org subdomains on it (with the domain name <code>p6c</code> instead of <code>perl6</code> for test purposes); the plan is to switch the perl6.org DNS over once all of the websites have been copied/migrated.</p>

<p>If you have a Perl 6 related use for a shell account or for serving websites, please request an account by email (moritz.lenz@gmail.com) or IRC (moritz on freenode and magnet), including:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Your desired username</li>
    <li>What you want to do on the machine(s) (not necessary for #perl6 regulars)</li>
    <li>Which of the machine(s) you need access to</li>
    <li>Optionally an openssh public key</li>
    <li>Whether you'd be willing to help a bit with sysadmin tasks (mostly <code>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get dist-upgrade</code>, restarting hung services, killing huge processes)</li>
    <li>Software you need installed (it's OK to not know this up-front)</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that <strong>feather.perl6.nl will shut down soon</strong> (no fixed date yet, but "end of 2014" is expected), so if you rely on feather now, you should consider migrating to the new server.</p>

<p>The <strong>code of conduct</strong> is pretty simple:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Be reasonable in your resource usage.</li>
    <li>Use technical means to limit your resource usage so that it doesn't accidentally explode (<a href="http://www.linuxhowtos.org/Tips%20and%20Tricks/ulimit.htm">ulimit</a> comes to mind).</li>
    <li>Limit yourself to legal and Perl 6-related use cases (no warez).</li>
    <li>Help your fellow hackers.</li>
</ol>

<p>The standard disclaimer applies:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Expect no privacy. There will potentially be many <code>root</code> users, who could all read your files and memory.</li>
    <li>There are no promises of continued service or even support. Your account can be terminated without notice.</li>
    <li>Place of jurisdiction in NÃ¼rnberg, Germany. You have to comply with German law while using the server. (Note that this puts pretty high standards on privacy for any user data you collect, including from web applications). It's your duty to inform yourself about the applicable laws. Illegal activities will be reported to the authorities.</li>
</ul>

<p>With all that said, <strong>happy hacking!</strong>.</p>
