<!-- 2017-05-01 -->
[% include p6-intro %]

<p>After some silence during the past few weeks, I can finally share
some exciting news about the book project. <a href="https://www.apress.com/">Apress</a>
has agreed to publish the book, both as print and electronic book.</p>

<p>The title is <em>Perl 6 Fundamentals</em>, with <em>A Primer with Examples, 
Projects, and Case Studies</em> as subtitle. The editorial process is happening
right now. I've received some great feedback on my initial manuscript, so there's
a lot to do for me.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more updates!</p>
