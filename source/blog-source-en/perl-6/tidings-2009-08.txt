Perl 6 Tidings from August 2009
<!-- 1251844362 -->

<p>It's been quite some time since my <a
href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/tidings-2009-06.html">last tidings
post</a>, so I don't think I can cover it all in great detail. I'll try
anyway.</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<ul>
    <li>File test operations now look like <code>$str.IO ~~ :e</code>
(r27503)</li>
    <li>Some cool regex features were documented that previously only existed
    unofficially (r27692, r27695)</li>
    <li>The want() function was removed as unimplementable (r27755).</li>
    <li>Subroutines without signatures don't always default to
    <code>(*@_, *%_)</code>, only when these variables are actually used
    (r27801).</li>
    <li>Nil coercions (r27882)</li>
    <li>Embedded comments now look like <code>#`[...]</code> (r27959)</li>
    <li><code>infix:&lt;/&gt;(Int, Int)</code> now produces a Rat object, that
    is a fraction.</li>
    <li>Changes to context, variables (r28151); <code>::=</code> now does
    read-only binding (instead of compile time binding as before)
    (r28150)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rakudo</h2>

<p>Rakudo had two releases by people other than Patrick Michaud, namely by me
and Kyle Hasselbacher.</p>

<p>Among the highlights are much improved introspection capabilities, user
defined traits, user defined and overloadable operators.</p>

<p>Jonathan also worked on the prototype of <a
href="http://github.com/jnthn/blizkost/tree/master">perl 5 integration into
parrot</a>.</p>


<h2>MP6</h2>

<p>Flavio Glock <a
href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.announce/2009/08/msg603.html">updated
mp6 and bootstrapped in on SBCL</a>.</p>
