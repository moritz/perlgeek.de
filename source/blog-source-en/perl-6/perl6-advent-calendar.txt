The Perl 6 Advent Calendar
<!-- 1259703562 -->

<p>In the great tradition of Perl Advent Calendars, colomon started and
announced <a href="http://perl6advent.wordpress.com/">the 2009 Perl 6 Advent
Calendar</a>, with a post about Perl 6 each day.</p>

<p>After the first post many #perl6 regulars volunteered to contribute a post,
so 20 of the 24 days are already allocated.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to many nice posts, most of which will probably
highlight a small Perl 6 feature.</p>
