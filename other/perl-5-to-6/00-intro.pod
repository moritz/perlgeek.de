=head1 NAME

"Perl 5 to 6" - Introduction

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Learn Perl 6 (if you already know Perl 5)
    Learn to love Perl 6
    Understand why

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl 6 is under-documented. That's no surprise, because (apart from the
specification) writing a compiler for Perl 6 seems to be much more urgent than
writing documentation that targets the user.

Unfortunately that means that it's not easy to learn Perl 6, and that you have
to have a profound interest in Perl 6 to actually find the motivation to learn
it from the specification, IRC channels or from the test suite.

This project, which I'll preliminary call "Perl 5 to 6" (for lack of a better
name) attempts to fill that gap with a series of short articles.

Each lesson has a rather limited scope, and tries to explain the two or three
most important points with very short examples. It also tries to explain why
things changed from PerlÂ 5 to 6, and why this is important. I also hope that
the knowledge you gain from reading these lessons is enough to basically
understand the Synopses, which are the canonical source of all Perl 6 wisdom.

To keep the reading easy, each lesson should not exceed 200 lines or 1000
words (but it's a soft limit).

Perhaps the lessons are too short to learn a programming language from them,
but I hope that they draw an outline of the language design, which allows you
to see its beauty without having to learn the language.

=head1 IT'S NOT

This is not a guide for converting Perl 5 to Perl 6 programs. It is also not a
comprehensive list of differences.

It is also not oriented on the current state of the implementations, but on
the ideal language as specified.

I'll also update these lessons from time to time make sure they are not too
outdated.
